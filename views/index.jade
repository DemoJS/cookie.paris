  h2 What is Cookie?
  p Cookie Demoparty is a digital art festival focused on real-time practices.
  p It has grown from being just a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoparty">demoparty</a>, and now includes other practices: experimental video games, playful installations, machinimas, live coding performances, and of course, live acts.
  p This year, we welcome you on <a href="/timetable">November 30 and December 1</a> at <a href="/location">Folie Num√©rique in Paris, France</a>.

  p Don't be afraid if you are a newcomer, people will kindly help you, so come and enjoy the party!
