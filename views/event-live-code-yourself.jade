  h2 Live Code Yourself!, by Tom Desai
  p Use a computer, 
  p make noises, blip, blop, and bloop.
  p Manipulate sound,
  p learn TidalCycles, create a generative loop. 
  p Play nicely together,
  p a single environment, letâ€™s use Troop!
  p Play with noise, 
  p use Supercollider, make frequencies stoop!
